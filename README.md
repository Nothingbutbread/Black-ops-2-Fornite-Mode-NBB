# Fornite Battle Royal Mod for Call of Duty: Black ops 2
Nothingbutbreads Implementation of Fortnite Battle Royal for Call of Duty: Black ops 2 targeting Jailbroken PS3's, Modded XBOX360's and PCs.

Usage of this mod is subject to Nothingbutbreads Terms of use that is distributed in all public releases/betas of this gamemode. The source code here is also subject to those as well. Before using the mod in a public game, please make sure level.debugger is set to false instead of true otherwise your game will run correctly. Set this true if you want to do things such as make map edits and such, it disables many aspects of the gamemode that are required for it to run normaly.

Reguarding builds: Builds are denoted with a VX.X.X form. The first X is the major version. Public Beta is marked as 1, with the offical release version being 2+. The next x is sub version, a completed update. The last x is a small incomplete update. Unless its marked [Hot fix], these are development versions that are incomplete.

I am allowing this to become a community project. If have a bug fix, improvement, optimization ect, do feel free to put in a pull request. If you wish to become a tester, download the code, compile it in GSC studio and run it. Post bugs in the issues tab for developors to fix. 

Dirrect Contributors: [Anyone who wrote any code speificly for this gamemode].
